# Shreya's Text-to-Speech Enchantment 🎙️✨

## Beginner's Introduction 🧙‍♂️✨

Hey, wizards-in-training! 🌟 [@shreyamalogi](https://github.com/shreyamalogi) here, and I'm super excited to tell you about this cool project I brewed up: the Text-to-Speech (TTS) Enchantment! 

### What's the Fuss About? 😯🎤

Imagine you type something on your computer, and poof! Your computer reads it out loud in a magical voice. That's exactly what this project does. It's like turning your written words into a magical podcast. 

### How to Make It Work 🐍✨

**Step 1: Get the Magic Recipe**
- You'll need a special language called Python on your computer. If you don't have it, ask a more experienced wizard to help you install it. 
- Also, make sure to have the magical ingredient called `gTTS`. You can add it with a magic spell:
  ```bash
  pip install gTTS
  ```

**Step 2: Cast the Spell**
1. Find a cozy spot on your computer where you can brew your spells.
2. Open the command wand (you know, the terminal).
3. Type the following spell to make it work:
   ```bash
   python tts.py
   ```
4. Your computer will ask you to type something. Go ahead, type anything you want to hear magically!

**Step 3: Hear the Magic**
- After typing, you'll find a new magical file named "SpeechOutput.mp3" in the same spot where you cast your spell. Click on it, and voila! Your computer is talking! 🎶🔊

### Extra Tricks (Optional)

If you want to make your computer sing the magic words directly from your spellbook (Python script), there's an extra spell called `mpyg321`. To add this spell, just say:
```bash
pip install mpyg321
```

## That's It! 

That's the magic of the Text-to-Speech Enchantment! Have fun typing and hearing your computer talk like magic. ✨💬

Remember, every great wizard started with simple spells. Keep practicing, and you'll become a coding sorcerer in no time! 🚀🔮
